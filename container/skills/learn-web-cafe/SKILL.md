# Learn from Web.Cafe

Use the `web-access` skill to explore and learn from the community.

## Required Browsing Mode

All Web.Cafe browsing should go through `web-access`.

- Load `web-access` first.
- Use the host browser through the `web_access_*` tools.
- Operate in your own background tab.
- Track every `targetId` you create.
- Close every tab you created after the work is complete, including tabs opened speculatively and never used.
- Prefer reusing an existing working tab instead of opening a new one unless parallel reading is actually useful.

## Web.Cafe Playbook

Web.Cafe is a UI-first site. Some entries have no useful `href` in the DOM. The safe rule is: **discover pages from the rendered UI, not from guessed URLs**.

### Hard Rules

- Never invent URLs from title, author, slug, or guessed patterns like `/post/...` or `/topic/...`.
- Never treat a guessed-URL `404` as evidence that the content does not exist.
- Never say "cannot navigate" until you have checked both `/targets` and `/info` after the click.
- Never use `WebFetch` as the main fallback for logged-in or client-rendered Web.Cafe content.
- If `/eval` is broken, say `/eval` is broken. Do not say Web.Cafe is broken.

### Success Criteria

A click is successful if either of these happens:

1. `/info` for the current tab changes to the target page.
2. `/targets` shows a new Web.Cafe detail tab opened by the source tab.

If the source tab URL does not change, that does **not** mean the click failed.

### Exact Workflow

1. Open or reuse one working tab on `https://new.web.cafe/`.
2. Record the current target list with `/targets`.
3. Inspect the page.
4. If the page has real article links, use those exact discovered links.
5. If the page only has clickable rendered titles, click the title node itself, not the article body, not the whole card, and not adjacent action buttons.
6. After every click, always do both checks:
   - `/targets`
   - `/info?target=<source-tab>`
7. If a new tab opened, switch work to that new target.
8. Close tabs you no longer need.

### Preferred Click Order

When a listing item is rendered like "title + excerpt + bookmark button", use this order:

1. title node
2. title wrapper on the left side
3. native `element.click()` on the title node

Do not click:

- the excerpt/body text
- the full card body
- bookmark, star, collect, or menu buttons

### Exact `/eval` Pattern

Use short, simple JS. Do not use long exploratory scripts when a small selector pass will do.

`/eval` body must be the raw JavaScript expression or IIFE. Do not wrap it in an extra string literal.

- Correct: `document.body.innerText.slice(0, 2000)`
- Wrong: `"document.body.innerText.slice(0, 2000)"`

If `/eval` returns the exact source text you sent, first check whether you accidentally wrapped the body in quotes.

```javascript
(() => {
  const el = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('p, h2, h3, a, span')).find(
    (node) => (node.textContent || '').trim() === 'Adsense 申请的正确流程',
  );
  if (!el) return JSON.stringify({ found: false });
  el.id = 'nc-target';
  el.scrollIntoView({ block: 'center' });
  return JSON.stringify({
    found: true,
    tag: el.tagName,
    text: (el.textContent || '').trim(),
  });
})();
```

Then run `/clickAt` on `#nc-target`.

### Exact Verification Pattern

Always use this sequence after clicking:

1. `GET /targets`
2. `GET /info?target=<source-tab>`

Interpretation:

- New Web.Cafe detail tab present: success
- Source tab URL changed to detail page: success
- Neither changed: retry with a more precise target

### If `/eval` Is Broken

If `/eval` returns the literal JS you sent, or just echoes the request body:

1. Mark `/eval` as unreliable in this runtime.
2. Continue using `/click`, `/clickAt`, `/targets`, `/info`, `/navigate`, `/back`.
3. Verify navigation only through tab creation and URL changes.
4. Do not pivot to guessed URLs.
5. Do not pivot to `WebFetch` for post bodies.

### Minimal Rescue Path

If the model is stuck, follow this exactly:

1. `GET /targets`
2. `GET /navigate?target=<tab>&url=https://new.web.cafe/`
3. `POST /eval` to tag one exact title node as `#nc-target`
4. `POST /clickAt` on `#nc-target`
5. `GET /targets`
6. `GET /info?target=<original-tab>`
7. If a new detail tab exists, continue there
8. If not, retry once with `element.click()` on the title node

### What Not To Misdiagnose

- `/eval` echoing input: tool problem
- source tab unchanged but new tab exists: successful navigation
- `WebFetch` missing article body: expected for this site, not proof of access failure
- screenshot file path mismatch: file-path/runtime problem, not site problem

## What to extract

First respect `## User Preference` at the top of `/workspace/group/notes/webcafe.md`.

- Use it as the scope filter for this session: it decides what to research, what to keep, and what to cut.
- Treat items marked as not important or not important for now as out of scope unless they are necessary context for a preferred topic.
- If a page is mostly out of scope, skip it. If it mixes high- and low-priority material, keep only the useful parts.

For each case study or discussion, capture the underlying methodology, not the surface details:

- **Promotion** — how did they drive traffic? What channels, tactics, or strategies did they use?
- **Niche discovery** — how did they find or come up with their niche? What was their thought process?
- **Market research** — what tools and methods did they use to validate demand? How did they assess competition?
- **Methodology and mindset** — what principles or frameworks guide their decisions? How do they think about risk, time investment, and tradeoffs?

## Learning Goal

Understand how experienced indie founders approach building and growing websites — their processes, tools, and mental models. Extract transferable insights about promotion channels, niche selection, market validation, and the mindset required for solo projects. Do not look for specific keywords or traffic numbers — those are symptoms, not causes.

## Working style

1. **Before starting**: Read `/workspace/group/notes/webcafe.md` thoroughly, including `## User Preference` at the top. Use that section to decide what is in scope this session, what to deprioritize, and which gaps are actually worth exploring.
2. **Explore and read**: Use `web-access` to discover and read relevant content. Start broad from the home page, `/experiences`, or `/tutorials`, then narrow down to specific pages by clicking through the rendered UI. Follow the `User Preference` scope filter while choosing pages and extracting findings. If a page has little text content but video, skip it.
3. **Cleanup**: Before finishing, close every `targetId` created during the session. Do not leave behind idle search tabs, 404 tabs, or speculative tabs that are no longer needed.

## About web.cafe

- https://new.web.cafe, home page shows latest posts across sections
- https://new.web.cafe/experiences — team experiences shared by the community owner
- https://new.web.cafe/tutorials — tutorial columns and articles
- The site search uses Simplified Chinese, so search in Chinese unless the term is widely-known in English (e.g. "SEO", "Adsense", "API")

## Completion checklist (REQUIRED before returning)

This skill is not complete until all of the following are done:

- [ ] Invoked `/refine-web-cafe-notes` to fully refine and distil the notes

## Avoid

- treating one post as proof of a winning strategy
- copying founder claims without extracting the underlying approach or reasoning
- **returning article titles as findings** — titles are not findings
- **surface-level summaries** — always ask "what is this person actually doing and why?"
- looking for specific keywords — focus on how niches are found and validated, not what the keywords are
- relying on a single page when broader evidence is available

- spending session time on topics that `## User Preference` says the user does not care about unless they are necessary context for a preferred topic

- leaving behind browser tabs created during the session, especially speculative search tabs that were never used
